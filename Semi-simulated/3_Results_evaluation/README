Results.R: the srcipts that generate evaluation results of each tool in different indel size ranges (with and without genotype-match was edited manually)
Genotype_evaluation.R: the scripts that generate evaluation results of each tool on homozygous precision, heterozygous precision and non-valid genetype proportion.
Parse_FP.R: first this script pick up FP results of each tools. Then the FP results of each tools was annotated by SimpleRepeats track from UCSC genome browser ()
