Results.R: the srcipts that generate evaluation results of each tool in different indel size ranges (with and without genotype-match was edited manually)
Genotype_homo_hetero.R: the scripts that generate evaluation results of each tool on homozygous precision, heterozygous precision.
Genotype_non-valid_multiallelic.R: the scripts that generate evaluation results of each tool on counts of non-valid genotype indel calls and multiallelic indel calls.
mary results according annotation.

Each sequencing setting has a folder. Under each sequencing setting folder, each tool has a folder:
deletion.txt and insertion.txt are the initial evaluation results of each tool. deletion_results.txt and insertion_results.txt are the tool's indel output, which only positions and sizes are extracted.
