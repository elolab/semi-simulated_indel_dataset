Results.R: the srcipts that generate evaluation results of each tool in different indel size ranges 1-20bp,20-50bp,50-200bp,200-500bp,>500bp (with and without genotype-match was edited manually)
Results_small_indels.R: the srcipts that generate evaluation results of each tool in different indel size ranges 1-10bp,10-20bp,20-30bbp,30-40bp,40-50bp (with and without genotype-match was edited manually)
Results_small_indels.R: the srcipts that generate evaluation results of each tool in different indel size ranges 30-70bp
Genotype_homo_hetero.R: the scripts that generate evaluation results of each tool on homozygous precision, heterozygous precision.
Genotype_non-valid_multiallelic.R: the scripts that generate evaluation results of each tool on counts of non-valid genotype indel calls and multiallelic indel calls.
mary results according annotation.
Results S3 Table.R: the srcipts that generate evaluation results of S3 table (S3 Table. The TPs, FPs, FNs, precision rates, recall rates and F1 scores of variant calling tool for all size ranges of deletions and insertions with the semi-simulated sequencing datasets.)
Results S7 Table.R: the srcipts that generate evaluation results of S7 table (S7 Table. The TPs, FPs, FNs, precision rates, recall rates and F1 scores of variant calling tool for small and large indels with the semi-simulated sequencing datasets.)

Each sequencing setting has a folder. Under each sequencing setting folder, each tool has a folder:
deletion.txt and insertion.txt are the initial evaluation results of each tool. deletion_results.txt and insertion_results.txt are the tool's indel output, which only positions and sizes are extracted.
