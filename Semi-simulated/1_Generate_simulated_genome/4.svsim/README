# MY CODE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Get insertion sequences from Venter genome
f = open("Haplotype_2_insertion.txt","r")
f_insertion = f.readlines()
n=-1  # hard to give n=n+1 after "return", so first n in return will be n=0
##
# Represents a insertion of a sequence in the
# genome starting at pos and ending at pos + length, either
# from a another location from_loc or if -1 a random sequence.
