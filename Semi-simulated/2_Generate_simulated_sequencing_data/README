This folder contain the scripts that 1) generate simulated sequencing reads; 2) tool execution command lines; 3) initial evaluation of tool-detected results with truth set

Each foldler contain: 
1) ART command line that generate simulated sequencing reads. 
2) BWA and SamTools command lines that generated BAM files as tools' input. 
3) Tool excution command lines
4) initial evaluation process: 1) tools' initial results were processed by vcftools (filter.indel.sh), to keep only indels; 2) with the removed indels vcf files, each tool had a specific R script to extract indels positions and sizes, and then compared with truth set

initial evaluation results are separated as deletion.txt and insertion.txt
initial tool outputs are separated as deletion_result.txt and insertion_result.txt
Those files are avaible at 3_Results_evaluation folder
